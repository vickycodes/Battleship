# **JS | Battleship Game**

## Introduction

In project week 1, as part of the Ironhack Web development bootcamp, I programmed a game.
I decided on the game "Battleship", reviving some of those childhood memories. 

Within this project I applied and made use of as many topics that we have learned in the first two weeks of the course, such as: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery as well as bootstrap methods.
